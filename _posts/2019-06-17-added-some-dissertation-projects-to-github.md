When I wrote my university dissertation in 2009, I stated that I would be
releasing the code under the GPL shortly after I graduated. I have now made
(mostly) true on that promise, just over ten years after I graduated.

The list of projects:

* [Screenshot](https://github.com/karlnicoll/Screenshot) - A C# library
  for taking a screenshot.
* [HIDDevices](https://github.com/karlnicoll/hiddevices-cs) - A C# library
  for enumerating an accessing Human Interface Devices (named by the redundant
  department of redundancy).
* [Wiimote](https://github.com/karlnicoll/wiimote) - A C# library inspired by
  [Brian Peek's WiimoteLib](https://github.com/BrianPeek/WiimoteLib) library
  for interfacing with a Nintendo Wii Remote.
* [Matrix](https://github.com/karlnicoll/matrix-cs) - A C# library that
  provides a basic `Matrix` class.
* [VectorQuantizer2D](https://github.com/karlnicoll/vectorquantizer2d) - A C#
  utility that quantizes 2-dimensional vectors using the
  [Generalized Lloyd Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm).
* [HiddenMarkovModel](https://github.com/karlnicoll/hiddenmarkovmodel-cs) - An
  implementation of a
  [Hidden Markov Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model).

I say _mostly_ for two reasons:

1. One project has not been released. The WiiSenter application was a
   standalone Winforms application that provided gesture recognition support
   for an MS PowerPoint presentation using the MS Office integration libraries.
   I wasn't happy with this code in 2009, and certainly not happy with it
   today. I may release the code for this at a later date.
2. Instead of GPL, I have used the
   [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) as I feel this will make
   the code more accessible to those who won't or can't use GPL licensed code.
