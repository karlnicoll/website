## Who are you?

My name is Karl, and I’m a husband, father of one, and a software
developer. I’m currently based out of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.
I like football, long distance running, mountain biking, most kinds of
music, movies and gaming.

I’m a Linux enthusiast and I run Arch or Ubuntu Linux on most of my PCs
at home.

In former lives, I've written .NET web systems for the
[NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/), cross-platform C++ for
[ACTIV Financial Systems](https://www.activfinancial.com/), and now I'm
starting a new journey developing robotics systems in C++ for
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com). I like to dabble in many different
programming languages including Python, Ruby, C#, PHP and Javascript,
and occasionally even shell scripts. I’m qualified with a BSc in
Computer Programming, which I achieved at
[Teesside University](https://www.tees.ac.uk) with first class honours.

## What is this place?

This is mainly a place where I keep my thoughts and links to my various
different projects. You can find most of my projects on my Github or on
my [portfolio](/portfolio) page.
