## Who are you?

My name is Karl, and I am a software engineer. I am currently working for
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com), working on the
[Scout autonomous delivery robot](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/meet-scout).
In previous lives, I have also written cross platform C++ server systems for
the FinTech industry at
[ACTIV Financial Systems (now part of the Options IT family)](https://www.options-it.com/),
and before that I was an ASP.NET developer for the UK
[National Health Service](https://www.nhs.uk/).

Perhaps more importantly, I am a husband and father of two.

I’m currently based out of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. I like football,
long distance running, mountain biking, most kinds of music, movies and
computer gaming.

I’m a Linux enthusiast and I run Arch or Ubuntu Linux on most of my PCs
at home, and feel most at home hacking with configs and code.

I’m qualified with a BSc in Computer Programming, which I achieved at
[Teesside University](https://www.tees.ac.uk) with first class honours.

## What is this place?

This is mainly a place where I keep my thoughts and links to my various
different projects. You can find most of my projects on my Github or on
my [portfolio](/portfolio) page.

I have a blog, but I don't usually post anything unless I have something
interesting or useful to say, so you can sometimes expect _years_ between posts
:-).
