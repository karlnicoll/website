# My Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal Website. The actual website can
be found here:

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The theme used is
based on the [`jekyll-oceanic`](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-oceanic)
template (full disclosure: I also wrote the template).
